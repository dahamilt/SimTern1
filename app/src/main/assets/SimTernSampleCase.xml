		<ChiefComplaint>Chest pain.</ChiefComplaint>
		<HistoryOfPresentIllness>A 58 year-old male with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease presents to the emergency room with acute onset of chest pain while shoveling snow after work.  He developed substernal chest pressure with radiation to his left arm while shoveling snow that was associated with nausea, diaphoresis, and shortness of breath, which was similar to his previous episodes of chest pain.  He took two nitroglycerin tablets on the way to the emergency room which relieved his pain, which lasted approximately 30 minutes.  He is currently pain free and states that all of his symptoms have resolved.  He is, however, very worried about his heart.  His last stress test was 5 years ago and he has never had a cardiac catheterization.    He took a baby aspirin this morning and was given a full strength aspirin in the emergency room.</HistoryOfPresentIllness>
